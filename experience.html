    <h2>Technical Skills</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>HTML - Through my years at PGCC I had the opportunity to learn HTML and CSS. HTML allows us to create the website's structure and organize it in a specific way.</li>
        <li>CSS - With CSS, we are able to personalize websites with specific colors, fonts, and align text and images.</li>
        <li>JavaScript - I learned some JavaScript at PGCC, but most of my JavaScript knowledge comes from an online course I took a while back.</li>
        <li>PHP - I took a PHP course at PGCC, which allowed me to learn how the backend works and how it is connected to the frontend.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Web Programming Experience</h2>
    <p class="par2">
        I have web programming experience since before transferring from PGCC to Bowie State University.<br> 
        I took many web development courses at PGCC and also learned from online courses.<br> 
        I have created websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br> 
        I also have some experience in the backend side of web development.<br> 
        I have used PHP as a backend language.
